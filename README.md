# Dice Game
This is a classic 2-player Dice Game created to practice DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic. The players can enter their names, roll the dice, and the game renders the results dynamically without reloading the page.

## Features
* **Dynamic Rendering:** The dice faces are drawn using CSS and controlled by JS classes (no images used).
* **Real-time Input:** Player names are updated instantly as you type (using `input` event).
* **Code Architecture:** Refactored from procedural code to reusable functions (DRY principle).
* **Game Logic:** Random number generation and conditional rendering using `switch` statements.

## Live Demo

## Built With
* **Semantic and accessible HTML5** - *to be added*
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Custom properties, Responsive design)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)

## What I Learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of:

1.  **DOM Events:** The difference between `keydown` and `input` events for real-time data handling.
2.  **Refactoring:** How to turn repetitive code into a clean, reusable `renderDice()` function.
3.  **Scope:** Managing variables properly to avoid global scope pollution.
4.  **Git Workflow:** Using branches and commit messages effectively.
